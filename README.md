    Bottom Sheet Scaffold
A bottom sheet scaffold is a UI pattern that slides up from the bottom of the screen to display additional content or options. It is typically used to show contextual information such as a list of options or a list of recently accessed items. Bottom sheet scaffolds are often used to provide a distraction-free environment for users to access additional information when it is needed.
   /*Backdrop Scaffold*/
The Backdrop scaffold is a UI pattern that provides a full-screen overlay when triggered. It is typically used to display additional content such as a menu, search bar, or other options related to the main content on the screen. The backdrop scaffold is useful for providing an extra layer of context and options to the user. You can also use the BackdropScaffold API to animate the background, font size and other elements of the layout.
     /*Navigation Drawer Scaffold*/
A navigation drawer scaffold is a UI pattern that provides a side-panel for navigating between different parts of the application. It is commonly used to provide access to an applicationâ€™s top-level navigation items, as well as any additional content. Navigation drawers are often used to provide quick access to important content or features when needed. It also provides an easy way to programmatically set up and control the navigation drawer. The Navigation Drawer Scaffold also makes it easy to add icons, headers and other components to the navigation drawer. Additionally, it provides a way to quickly move between different screens without having to manually create navigation logic. This allows you to quickly create a navigation-style user interface in your app with minimal effort.
